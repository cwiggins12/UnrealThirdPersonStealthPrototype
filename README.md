As shown in the description, this was mostly just me trying to answer the question of how to use the base third person template of
Unreal to see how easily I could implement something similar to the Metal Gear Solid alert system and to watch some tutorials on interaction systems and seeing new ways to save and load world states. This was also a bit of an exercise to get a pipelined way to upload full Unreal projects to GitHub for future projects.
The .mp4 of gameplay is provided for any one to see its current progress.
