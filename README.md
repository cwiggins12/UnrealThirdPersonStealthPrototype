As shown in the description, this was mostly just me trying to answer the question of how to use the base third person template of
Unreal to see how easily I could implement something similar to the Metal Gear Solid alert system. This was also a bit of an exercise
to get a pipelined way to upload full Unreal projects to GitHub for future projects.
